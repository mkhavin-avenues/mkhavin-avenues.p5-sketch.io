What was challenging for you during this process? one thing that was challenging for me was that I had to figure out how to make my shapes go in the spaces that I wanted them to 
What makes more sense now than it did before you started? something that makes a lot more sence now than it did before is remembering how to color all the shapes I thought it was a lot more difficulet than it really was
What are you proud of? I am mostly proud of how long it took me at first I thought I would take me a long time but then when I realized that I can rely on the help page the project went a lot faster than I thought. 
I first though of making all my figures limbs large shapes but then realized that I would be a lot more eficent and easy if I just use lines to make its limbs.
